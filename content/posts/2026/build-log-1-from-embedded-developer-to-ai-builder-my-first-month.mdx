## The Night I Couldn't Sleep

For years, I've been writing low-level C code for automotive MCUs. Debugging hardware registers, optimizing firmware — that was my world. Web development? I had never built a single webpage.

Then I tried Claude Code.

I gave it a description of what I wanted to build, and within hours, I was looking at a working web application. That night, I couldn't sleep. Not from anxiety — from excitement.

What I was seeing wasn't just a cool tool. It was an industrial revolution happening in real time. And I knew I had to be part of it.

## Zero Web Experience. Three Services in One Month.

I spent the next month going all-in on AI-assisted development. Here's what I built — with zero prior web development experience.

### PawCheck — AI Pet Health Checker

My first project was PawCheck, a web-based service that analyzes pet photos for potential health concerns using AI.

I built the entire thing in 3 days. It includes one-time and subscription payment processing, multi-language support, and a global service architecture.

Three days. For a payment-ready, globally accessible web service. As someone who used to spend weeks debugging a single UART driver, this felt unreal.

### CraftAI — AI Personal Styling Service

Next, I built CraftAI — upload your photo, and AI recommends your optimal style. This one also includes payment integration for per-use billing.

### AI Craft Log — This Blog

Finally, I built the blog you're reading right now. A full-featured, SEO-optimized tech blog with categories, tags, dark mode, and search — built in 3 days with Claude Code and Next.js.

## What "Vibe Coding" Actually Feels Like

People call it "vibe coding" — describing what you want in natural language and letting AI build it. But that undersells what's really happening.

It's more like having a conversation with a senior developer who never gets tired. You describe the architecture, debate trade-offs, and iterate together. When something breaks, you debug it together.

The real surprise wasn't that AI could write code. It was that **I could understand the code it wrote.** By reviewing what Claude Code generated, I learned React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and payment integration — not from tutorials, but from actual working code built for my own projects.

AI didn't replace my learning. It accelerated it by 10x.

## The Walls Are Coming Down

I used to think web development was a completely different discipline. You needed years of frontend experience, design skills, and deployment expertise.

That wall is crumbling.

With AI, the barrier between "I have an idea" and "I have a working product" has never been lower. The most valuable skill isn't knowing a specific framework — it's knowing what to build and why.

## What's Next

I've made a decision. I'm going to document everything — every build, every failure, every dollar earned (or not earned). This blog is my public logbook.

Here's what I believe:

> **We're entering an era where one person with AI can build what used to require a team.**

> **The question isn't whether this will happen. It's whether you'll be the one building.**

This is Build Log #1. Many more to come.
