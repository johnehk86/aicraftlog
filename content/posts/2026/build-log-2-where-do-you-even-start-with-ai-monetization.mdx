I wanted to build something with AI that could actually make money. But where do you start?

## Why This Matters Now

We're living in an era where the value of labor is shifting. Working hard at a company doesn't guarantee rewards that match your effort anymore.

I believe the people who will thrive in the coming years are those who use AI to create new value and new income streams. And I believe now is the time to start — even if you're starting from zero.

Beyond short-term revenue, what matters most is building your own story, your own brand, your own value. That's what lasts.

## The Idea: Build My Own Blog, Monetize with AdSense

So I thought: what if I build my own blog from scratch using AI, and monetize it with Google AdSense?

I'm not starting completely blind. Years ago, I ran a blog on a Korean platform (Tistory) that attracted **1.9 million total visitors** and earned up to **$550/month** at its peak.

But I stopped managing it for 3 years, and the revenue dropped to almost nothing.

That experience taught me something important: blog income is real, but it requires consistency. This time, I'm building something I own — and I'm going to stay consistent.

## How Blog Monetization Actually Works

The model is straightforward:

### Step 1: Write Content

Create valuable content on your blog. Optimize for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) so Google ranks your posts on the first page when people search for relevant topics.

### Step 2: Traffic Comes In

Visitors find your blog through Google search, social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit), YouTube, and developer communities.

### Step 3: Ads Generate Revenue

Google AdSense automatically displays relevant ads. When visitors see or click ads, you earn money. Typical rates: $0.01–$0.10 per click, or $1–$10 per 1,000 page views.

### Step 4: Reinvest and Grow

Revenue funds better content, new AI services, and YouTube growth — which drives more traffic. More traffic means more revenue. It's a flywheel.

**The core loop: Great content → Traffic → Ad revenue → Reinvest → More traffic.**

## My First Target: 50,000 Monthly Visitors

To earn $1,000/month from AdSense, here's the math:

*   1,000 monthly visitors → $2–$5
    

*   10,000 monthly visitors → $50–$100
    

*   50,000 monthly visitors → $250–$500
    

*   100,000 monthly visitors → $500–$1,000
    

*   200,000 monthly visitors → **$1,000 achieved**
    

My first milestone: **50,000 monthly visitors.** At that point, I'll explore multiple revenue streams beyond just AdSense.

To get there, I need consistently valuable content. My angle: **documenting how I use AI to build real products and monetize them.** This is the content that will drive traffic.

## Why I Built My Own Blog (Instead of Using a Platform)

You might wonder: why not just use Medium, [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com), or Substack?

Here's why:

Platform blogs help you get started fast. But for long-term monetization, a self-built blog is a **digital asset you actually own.**

I always wanted to build my own blog, but the technical barrier made it impossible — until AI changed everything. I built [aicraftlog.com](http://aicraftlog.com) in 3 days with Claude Code.

## The Blog I Built with AI

Here it is — a fully functional blog with publishing, comments, subscriptions, and monetization-ready architecture:

## What's Coming Next

Building the blog, connecting AdSense, developing AI services, marketing, expanding to YouTube — I'm going to show all of it. The revenue, the failures, everything out in the open.

**Next post: I'll reveal exactly how I built this blog with AI in just 3 days.**
