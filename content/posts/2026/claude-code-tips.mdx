## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a CLI-based AI coding assistant built by Anthropic. It can read, modify, and execute code directly in your terminal, significantly boosting development productivity.

## Effective Prompt Writing

### 1. Be Specific

```
❌ "Fix this code"
✅ "In src/lib/posts.ts, the getAllPosts function sorts
    dates in ascending order — change it to descending"
```

### 2. Provide Context

Sharing your project's tech stack and structure upfront leads to more accurate results.

<Callout type="info">
Organizing your project info in a CLAUDE.md file lets Claude automatically reference it.
</Callout>

### 3. Take a Step-by-Step Approach

For complex tasks, breaking them into steps is more effective than requesting everything at once:

1. First, have it analyze the current code
2. Then, have it create a change plan
3. Finally, implement according to the plan

## Common Patterns

### Understanding File Structure

```bash
# When you want to understand the full project structure
"Analyze this project's directory structure
 and explain the role of each file"
```

### Bug Fixing

```bash
# Provide the error message
"Running npm run build produces this error:
 [error message]
 Please fix this error"
```

### Refactoring

```typescript
// Before: Repetitive code
function getUser(id: number) { /* ... */ }
function getPost(id: number) { /* ... */ }
function getComment(id: number) { /* ... */ }

// After: Generic pattern suggested by Claude
async function fetchById<T>(endpoint: string, id: number): Promise<T> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/${endpoint}/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}
```

## Productivity Tips

| Tip | Description |
|---|---|
| `/compact` | Summarize when context gets long |
| CLAUDE.md | Auto-load project context |
| Parallel tasks | Request independent tasks simultaneously |
| Code review | Ask Claude for review before PRs |

## Conclusion

Claude Code isn't just a code generation tool — it's a partner that accelerates your entire development process. Maximize your productivity through effective prompt writing and workflow optimization.
