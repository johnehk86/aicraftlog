In the previous post, I showed you how to install Claude Code and write the first command.

This time, I'm revealing **every command I gave, in what order**, to complete [aicraftlog.com](http://aicraftlog.com).

## The Key to Prompting: Show, Don't Tell

Giving commands to AI — prompting — matters.

But instead of writing long descriptions, **showing a screenshot of a blog you like** is far more effective.

AI analyzes images and understands layout, colors, and structure all at once. One screenshot beats a hundred words of explanation.

### How I Actually Did It

**Step 1:** Find a blog you like and take a screenshot.

**Step 2:** Drag & drop the screenshot into the Claude Code terminal, then type:

`I want to build a blog like this.   The purpose is to write articles about making money using AI.   I want it to be a clean, easy-to-read blog.   I'd also like subscription and comment features.`

With just this, Claude Code builds the skeleton of the entire blog.

**Step 3:** Once the skeleton is ready, request details one by one.

`Only admins should be able to write posts.   I want to schedule posts for a specific publish time.`

`Make the blog color scheme blue.`

`Use this logo file for the blog.`

This is how the blog was built — start with the big picture, then refine the details one by one.

The final source code is public on GitHub:

## Reverse Engineering: Making AI Analyze Its Own Work

After the blog was complete, I asked AI this:

`Analyze the blog I just built.   If someone else wanted to build the same thing,   what prompts would they need to give you, and in what order?`

The result: **10 phases, 24 prompts.**

Here's the full breakdown.

* * *

## Phase 1: Project Setup (Prompts 1–2)

Like laying the foundation before building a house.

### Prompt 1 — Create the Project

`Create a Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project.   Project name: aicraftlog.   I'll deploy to Cloudflare Pages.   Use Space Grotesk (English), Pretendard (Korean), JetBrains Mono (code) fonts.`

**Result:** Project folder, config files, and starter pages generated automatically.

### Prompt 2 — Dark Mode & Theme

`Add dark mode support. Default to light mode.   Set a blue color scheme as the primary color.`

**Result:** Light/dark mode toggle and the blog's color theme is set up.

* * *

## Phase 2: Blog Content System (Prompts 3–4)

The core of any blog — writing and displaying posts.

### Prompt 3 — Markdown Blog Structure

Building what visitors actually see.

### Prompt 5 — Layout

`Create the blog layout.   Header: logo, navigation, search, theme toggle, mobile menu.   Footer: newsletter subscribe, links, copyright.   Sidebar: recent posts, tag list, category post counts.   Add a mobile bottom navigation bar.`

**Result:** Header, footer, sidebar, mobile nav — the blog's skeleton is complete.

* * *

## After 24 Prompts

This blog is ultimately **a bundle of code files.**

How to manage that code and deploy it so anyone in the world can visit — that process matters too.

So in the next post, I'll cover how I manage the code with Git and deploy through Cloudflare Pages.

But before that, here are **three tips** for working better with AI.

* * *

## 3 Tips for Better AI Prompting

### 1. Don't ask for everything at once

"Build me an entire blog" gives worse results than breaking it into steps. Like building a house: foundation → frame → interior → exterior. Give AI tasks in order, and you get solid results.

### 2. Check results before moving on

After each command, always verify the output and fix issues before proceeding. This is the secret to stable results.

### 3. AI is the tool. Planning is your job.

AI writes the code, but you decide what to build. I didn't plan 10 phases from the start either. I began by showing a screenshot and saying "build something like this," then added features one by one. As you talk with AI, the structure takes shape naturally.
