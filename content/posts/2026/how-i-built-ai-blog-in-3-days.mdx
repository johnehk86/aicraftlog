Ever wondered if you could build a fully functional, SEO-optimized blog from scratch in just 3 days? I did it — and I'm not even a frontend developer.

## Why I Built This Blog

I'm an embedded software developer at a major automotive company. My daily work involves MCUs and low-level C code — about as far from web development as you can get. But I wanted a space to document my AI-powered development journey, and existing platforms like Medium or Tistory didn't give me full control.

So I decided to build my own.

## The Tech Stack

Here's what I used:

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
    
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
    
*   **Content:** MDX (Markdown + JSX)
    
*   **Deployment:** Cloudflare Pages
    
*   **Domain:** [aicraftlog.com](http://aicraftlog.com) via Cloudflare
    
*   **AI Assistant:** Claude Code in GitHub Codespaces
    

## Day 1: Setting Up the Foundation

I started by opening a GitHub Codespace and installing Claude Code. Within the first hour, I had a basic Next.js project running. Claude Code handled most of the boilerplate — routing, layout components, and Tailwind configuration.

The biggest win was telling Claude Code exactly what I wanted: "Build me a tech blog with categories, tags, dark mode, and SEO optimization." It scaffolded the entire structure.

## Day 2: Content System and Design

Day 2 was all about making the blog actually usable. I set up the MDX content pipeline, created the category system (Build Log, AI Tools, Tutorial), and designed the blog listing page.

I went through several iterations on the layout — from a grid view to a clean single-column list with thumbnails on the left and titles on the right. The single-column layout won for readability.

## Day 3: SEO, Analytics, and Polish

The final day was about making everything production-ready:

*   Added Google Analytics and Search Console integration
    
*   Set up sitemap.xml and robots.txt for SEO
    
*   Configured Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
    
*   Added a dark mode toggle
    
*   Deployed to Cloudflare Pages
    

## What I Learned

Building a blog as a non-frontend developer taught me a few things:

**AI coding tools are game-changers.** Claude Code didn't just autocomplete — it understood the architecture I wanted and built it. I spent more time making decisions than writing code.

**Start simple, iterate fast.** My first version looked rough. But getting something live quickly meant I could improve it based on real feedback.

**The hardest part isn't coding.** It's deciding what to build and how it should look. The technical execution with AI assistance was the easy part.

## What's Next

This blog is just the beginning. I'll be documenting every AI-powered project I build here — from pet health checkers to styling services. If you're interested in building with AI, stick around.
